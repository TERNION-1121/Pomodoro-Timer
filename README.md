## üìÉ Description

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The most famous of all productivity, especially time-management tips, the Pomodoro Technique is a method to do work without stress, efficiently, and that too with fun!

1. Begin a timer for **25-30 minutes**, do the work you wish to focus on during this session
2. After the main session, begin another timer for **5 minutes**. This is the break timer, where you take a break from your work (usually listening to music, walking etc.).
3. Done with the break? Begin another Pomodoro session!
4. Repeat till you are done with about 3-4 sessions. Take a bigger break of about **20-30 minutes** this time.

One of the reasons this method is the most effective is, it breaks down complex work schedules into simpler ones; And the 5 minutes breaks often serve as a game reward for the work done! This in turn encourages the brain to do more of these sessions.

### The "Why?" of the Project

I often use the Pomodoro Technique for my studies. But it was when I saw this [Youtube Short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RSNHZ2OsQPE) by Coding With Lewis _(thanks a lot Lewis :)_, I got the idea to code a Pomodoro Timer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
I saw it as a great opportunity to make my firstever, **BIG**, GUI application. And that's when I sat down with Python to get on this project.                                                                               
Tkinter is a great and famous tool used by Python Developers to make GUI applications, but since I had a little bit experience with the [`pygame`](www.pygame.org) library, I decided to use it. _(next time Tkinter :)_

### üéØChallenges, ‚ú®Features & üìùLearnings

While coding this project, I had a simple approach in mind:

- Have fade animations with the text and button widgets,
- & Have sounds upon interactions with the application.

Yet, to achieve these features, it took me long to fix the bugs that ocurred while coding it.
I came to learn a lot of stuff on my own! But most importantly it was [@Legendary3995](https://github.com/Legendary3995) _(thanks a lot :D)_ who helped me to tackle the automatic pause upon holding the window at the title bar, a problem which _(almost)_ looked impossible to fix on my own.                                                                                                                                                              

At the present moment, the application is at its [`pre-release v1.0.0`](https://github.com/TERNION-1121/Pomodoro-Timer/releases/tag/v1.0.0), with really simple features.
For the future, I have many aspirations for the project, which I wish to achieve soon, maybe even before with the support of you all!
- Adding the settings tab.
- Adding the feature of customizing the main and the break timer.
- Switching between light and dark mode.
- Changing alarm sounds.
- Adding a special slide/scene after completion of 3 or 4 Pomodoros.

## How to use the Project

To download the application installer, head towards the pre-release section of this repository; or, [click here](https://github.com/TERNION-1121/Pomodoro-Timer/releases/download/v1.0.0/pomodoro-timer_setup.exe).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Run through the installer, and the click the Desktop Icon of the Pomodoro Timer to run the application.

## On "How to Contribute"

There's a LOT, that you all can contribute to this project!
Since it's my first GUI Application, and it's in its pre-release, I'd be more than grateful if you could list out any of the bugs/issues you found by raising an [issue](https://github.com/TERNION-1121/Pomodoro-Timer/issues).                                                                                                                                                                                                               
For more:
- You can contribute to the README.md (beautify or elaborate it maybe?
- Make changes for a better and cleaner code. (This is my first time so I had tried my best to code clean!)
- Suggest features that can be later added.

<br>

That wraps up almost everything I wish to explain and tell about the Pomodoro Timer! I hope you had enjoyed reading, understanding the code, and most importantly using the application itself!
